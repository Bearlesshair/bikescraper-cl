Brainstorming:
Query needs to handle multiple pages of results

More error handling for requests

Make all calls from bikescraper-cl.py

Store listings fetched in JSON for comparison purposes (minimizes unnecessary post fetching)

AND, OR, NOT config parsing

Gmail sender

Option to export-all or get-new


Implementation changes:
config.py -> New options to export changed/total and to send via gmail
query.py -> Add multiple page results functionality
DONE query.py -> Store fetched listings in dictionary -> Pass to get-changed.py -> Write all to JSON
DONE get-changed.py -> Compare fetched with current JSON -> Return dictionary of changed listings
query.py -> Return both total and changed dictionaries
bikescraper-cl.py -> Either export total via excel.py OR Export changed via excel.py and send via gmail.py


Multiple configurations???
